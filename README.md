## ¿How has evolved the Metro service during the last years?

	• The objective of this project is to show how has increased the mobility and inflow in the metro service. 
		○ Charts showing historical data. 
		○ Maps showingPpeople concentration in each station. 
		
		
		
Datasets to use:


https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/explore/dataset/estaciones-metro/table/

https://www.metro.cdmx.gob.mx/operacion/cifras-de-operacion

https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/explore/dataset/afluencia-del-metro/table/

## Objective:
To tell a story about the netro and how has the influx of the most important stations behaved. 

## What we did: 
1) Define the topic, that in fact, rather than choosing a topic, we choose data that will work for us to apply ETL, Geomapping, SQlite
2) In ETL, cleaning, transforming and selecting the correct data for the project.
3) The different skills of the team members helped us to collaborate, at times, separately. The disposition of all so that any doubt that arises was solved with what each one has learned or included with searches in Internet.
4) In this aspect, the ETL process was worked together, in particular, the members developed the graphs, the map, the fun facts and the bonus game.
5) The main challenge in developing the project was the final part, specifically the connection with flask and then heroku.

## Which Challenges we faced: 
First, we struggled to have a correct SQLite DATABASE, at the end we managed to have something in order to work with the Flask,
The Challenge that we faced was that with Flask other html files were not displaying, as well as images and javascripts.

Therefore, we couldn't finish the flask app with all the attributes in our webpage, and our plan was to build a heroku application to finish the project, but we struggled with this activity.



## How can it be improved:
With the database that we have, we can actually compare other transportation services and how have they impacted the influx of the metro in the last years.


Luis Cambero comments:
* As always we faced issues on selecting the topic.
* Once we decided the topic we worked on searching the data.
* We did ETL in order to start working on the middle ware, SQLite.
* Building the database and tables was challenging because we need to selected which data and type should be used to feed the frontend.
* At the end the middleware connected successfully to the frontend...
